<a href="login?next=fakeLoginPage">localhost:5000/login?next=fakeLoginPage</a>
<pre>
An attacker could send this valid website link in phishing attacks.
This link is 100% legitimate as it is hosted by the webiste.

However, notice the "localhost:5000/fakeLoginPage" part after "next=".
For this insecure website, it means on a successful login, that url will be the next page displayed.
If we change "fakeLoginPage" to "https://www.google.com/" it would redirect to google instead

That means if the user logs in succesfully, the attacker can redirect them to their own page.
A tactic could be to redirect users to an identical login page owned by the attacker
The victim would think they entered their details wrong (even though they didn't) and re-enter them on the attackers website instead.

If this was a real attack on a real website, the urls would be obviously change.
